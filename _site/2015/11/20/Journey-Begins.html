  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>For a few years now I have been playing aroud with data visualisation in my spare time, learning D3, dipping my toes into Processing and Tableau, reading articles and books with some vague future idea that one day I will change my career and work on this full time. But life gets in the way and soon you realise that you are spending a small fortune on sports channels and whiling away your free time watching German third division football.</p>

<p>Then a few weeks ago I watched <a href="https://vimeo.com/113312415">Santiago Ortiz’s talk at Eyeo in 2014</a>. It kind of blew me away. In the talk he describes how he found himself without work but also in a position where he could devote six months full time to learning the things he felt he needed to get himself to a position where he could make a living from the work he loved. I was completely besotted with the idea and started to plan how I could do something similar. However, being of a slightly nervous nature I decided that leaving my job at a sustainability charity in London wasn’t really an option right now so pared back my plans somewhat. So I am going to spend the next 12 months deciding where I want to get to and how I am going to get there and getting there, and this blog is going to be a record of how I get on.</p>

<p>Another thing which really resonated with me recently was an interview I read with <a href="http://www.brendandawes.com/">Brendan Dawes</a>, in <a href="http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/en/thoughts-on-designing-information">Thoughts on Designing Information</a>, in which he says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the reasons I try to make a lot of things is because I believe that it is important to practice the craft to become
better at making things. The brain is a muscle: the more you exercise it the better it becomes. That is why I make a lot of 
stuff… You have to take ideas from your sketchbook and execute the ones you like. Once you get them made, you have to publish 
them. That is what the internet is all about: the ability to push things out there so people can see it and criticize it… We 
like to play with stuff and see where it goes. Sometimes with no end goal in sight. We have done lots of experiments 
without knowing how how we were going to use them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This approach really resonated with me, and if I was being generous I would say this was unknowingly how I was approaching this kind of work in the past. So rather than building something and saving it in a folder on my laptop, I thought it would be good to publish everything I make on a timeline called my <a href="http://davidstelfox.github.io">play portfolio</a> to map my progression over the next 12 months.</p>

<p>12 months, the start of a plan, a blog and a timeline. Let’s see where this takes me.</p>
