Quick one this week

###I received this year's copy of Nick Felton's Annual Report###

I was a bit gutted I only came across Nick Felton's Annual Reports a couple of years ago meaning I missed out on 8 years of being able to receive these amazing pieces. The colour choices, layouts and was he represents his data via chart, numbers and text I find so intriguing and beautiful. I seem to remember watching a talk he gave where he spoke about putting together a book once he had finished the project with his report. Definitely one to pre-order.

###Some things I saw or read that I liked###
[This report on whether the highest grossing films pass the Bechdel test](http://poly-graph.co/bechdel/) by Polygraph. Especially this chart:

For some reason this chart really got into my head. I was still thinking about for a couple of days after I first saw it. I took an inordinately long amount of time getting a gif of it so I could tweet it. Why? Technically, I really liked the interactivity, the animations and the way you can switch between size of the circles representing the box office revenue as just as markers, and it seems to all be done in D3 - something to definitely aim towards. On an interpretation level, it tells the story it is meant to so well. While measurements may not be measured in every instance the multiple stories it is trying to get across are all delivered in a single chart. Definitely one of my favourites of 2016 so far.
