In a recent episode of the [Steercast](http://podcast.steer.me/46/), [Mike McQuaid](http://mikemcquaid.com/), an engineer at GitHub spoke about imposter syndrome being one of the main issues for people learning to code:

> A really common thing is [the] concept of imposter syndrome. This concept that you feel like, "I'm out of place here, I don't know what I'm doing and 
> actually I'm going to get found out, and when people find out, they'll maybe at best laugh at me, at worst get me fired."

This is something I can feel pretty badly when working on data visualisation. I came to coding pretty late without doing anything approaching this at university, more fell into it. I have also learned pretty much all I know in isolation. The internet is an amazing thing but it is also the worst thing. My Pocket and Medium bookmarks are full of articles of how people have developed things or how companies have implemented analytics stacks or somesuch but each time I look at these I am overcome with dread that I don't know enough or that my (own percieved) lack of knowledge is going to make me look like a dick when I talk or interact with people. Recently I attended to London D3js meetup and it hit pretty hard, without talking to anyone I felt a real sense of anxiety that I was in a room full of experts who know so much more. Is this true? Maybe. Does it matter? Not so much. 

Afterwards thinking about this over the course of the next year this should get better. The more I learn and develop, the less this anxiety should occur, right?! Let's see. Each time imposter syndrome strikes I will add a note to the timeline (red dot). If my idea above is correct then the dots should become less frequent or not and then, shit, it is something I am going to have to get better at dealing with as Mike goes on to speak about in the podcast.
