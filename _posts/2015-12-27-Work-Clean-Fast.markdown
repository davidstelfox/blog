A couple of years ago I got interested in quantified self, the process of collecting data about yourself and looking for insights. One of the processes I set up was an IFTTT job which writes a line to a Google Spreadsheet each time I listen to a song on Spotify. I enjoy the Spotify Year in Music so decided that as I had collected the data I would put something together as a project. It'd be a good opportunity to practice publishing multiple parts to a single webpage and practicing some graphical layouts, something I often feel I struggle with.

While doing this I came across a problem I found difficult: multi-line charts in D3. This is something which is relatively straightforward to do in graphical charting tools I use like Excel or SSRS or Tableau but seems to be a larger jump in D3 to what I have done before. I kind of understand paths but looking through a few examples there were processes I was struggling to get my head around and was resorting to the slightly desparate method of copy/pasting segments of code and changing variable names in the hope this worked. Then I stopped and remembered a Tweet I had seen a while ago which struck a chord with me:

> I've been repeating the principles on the right order of coding to myself lately:
> 1. Make it work
> 2. Make it clean
> 3. Make it fast

For me at this stage, the first point is the most important. It doesn't matter if my code is super clean or fast, I am not writing production code, I am writing small web pages displaying charts. The harder concepts will come with time and practice, for now it is about publishing my work and learning, learning, learning. So working on this basis I made the code work; it is not clean, it might be fast but it works. Enough for now.
